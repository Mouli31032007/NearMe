    <p>Hogenakkal Falls is a waterfall on the Cauvery River in the Dharmapuri district of Tamil Nadu, known as the "Niagara of India". The name "Hogenakkal" is derived from Kannada and means "smoky rocks" because the water cascading over the rocks resembles smoke. Visitors can enjoy coracle boat rides, which are traditional round boats, and bathe in the waters, which are believed to have medicinal properties. The area is also famous for its fish, oil massages, and trekking opportunities.  </p>
